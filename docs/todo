* __iter__ attribute for more types (such as tuple, dict, set)

* make list comprehensions more efficient for lists (currently gratuitous append)

* range(), len(), map() and other useful top level functions.

* import statements

* sets

* keyword arguments

* default arguments

* some way to include Python code in the standard libraries, and compile it with berp so that it 
is available to user programs (obvious example is to compile Python __builtins__ this way, such as map,
range etcetera).
